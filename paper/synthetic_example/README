# analysis steps
- generate synthetic test beam and test images (synthetic_beam/generate_beam.ipynb)
    - use distgen to generate simple beam using gaussian.yaml and then modify dist in
     + track synthetic beam through lattice in generate_test_beam.py (called in
     generate_beam.ipynb)
    - note number of particles -> can get expensive
- fit images using fitting.py
- analyze in various notebooks
